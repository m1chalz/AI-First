# API Contracts

**Feature**: Pet Details Screen (Android UI)  
**Date**: 2025-11-25

## Note

This is a UI-only feature. No new API contracts are required.

The feature consumes existing animal data through the  interface. The repository method  will be added to fetch a single animal by ID, but this is an internal implementation detail and does not require new API contracts.

If backend API changes are needed in the future, they should be documented in the backend API specification.
