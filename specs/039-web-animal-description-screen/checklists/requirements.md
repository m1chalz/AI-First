# Specification Quality Checklist: Web Animal Description Screen

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: December 2, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (P1: happy path, P2: alternate paths, P3: error handling)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

✅ **SPEC READY FOR PLANNING** - All items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for technical planning.

### Notes

- Specification builds on established patterns from specs 034 and 037 for consistency
- All required fields are identified and validation rules are explicit
- Responsive design requirements align with existing web app standards
- "Request GPS position" button is a visual placeholder only (no functionality in this spec)
- GPS location capture will be implemented in a separate specification
- Flow state management architecture is consistent with previous web steps
- **IMPORTANT**: Back arrow navigation clarified - in-app back arrow navigates to previous step (preserving state), browser back button cancels entire flow. Specs 034 and 037 need updating to implement this consistent behavior.
