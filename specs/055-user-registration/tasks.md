# Tasks: User Registration Endpoint

**Feature**: 055-user-registration  
**Date**: December 15, 2025  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/055-user-registration/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/post-users.yaml

**Tests**: This is a **backend-only feature** affecting only `/server` module.

**MANDATORY - Backend Unit Tests**:
- Services: `/server/src/services/__test__/` (Vitest), 80% coverage
- Utilities: `/server/src/lib/__test__/` (Vitest), 80% coverage
- Framework: Vitest
- Scope: Business logic and utility functions
- TDD Workflow: Red-Green-Refactor cycle (write failing test, minimal implementation, refactor)
- Convention: MUST follow Given-When-Then structure with descriptive test names

**MANDATORY - Backend Integration Tests**:
- Location: `/server/src/__test__/`
- Coverage: 80% for REST API endpoints
- Framework: Vitest + SuperTest
- Scope: End-to-end API tests (request → response)
- Convention: MUST follow Given-When-Then structure

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Database schema setup and initial project structure

- [X] T001 Create database migration for user table in `/server/src/database/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_user_table.ts`
- [X] T002 Run migration to create user table in SQLite database
- [X] T003 [P] Verify migration rollback works correctly

**Checkpoint**: Database schema ready for user registration

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core validation and error handling infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 [P] RED: Write failing unit test for password validation in `/server/src/lib/__test__/validators.test.ts`
- [ ] T005 [P] RED: Write failing unit test for email validation wrapper in `/server/src/lib/__test__/validators.test.ts`
- [ ] T006 [P] GREEN: Implement `validatePassword()` function in `/server/src/lib/validators.ts` (8-128 chars)
- [ ] T007 [P] GREEN: Implement `validateEmail()` wrapper function in `/server/src/lib/validators.ts` (reuses existing `isValidEmail()`)
- [ ] T008 REFACTOR: Extract validation constants (MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH, MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH, MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH) to `/server/src/lib/validators.ts`
- [ ] T009 Verify validator tests pass and achieve 80%+ coverage
- [ ] T010 [P] Run code formatter on `/server/src/lib/validators.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Successful User Registration (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable new users to create accounts by providing email and password, with secure password hashing and UUID generation

**Independent Test**: Submit POST request to `/api/v1/users` with valid data `{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}` and verify HTTP 201 response with `{"id": "uuid"}` and user creation in database

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - can start in parallel with US1 but should test independently
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 and User Story 2 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 validation but independently testable

### Within Each User Story (TDD Workflow)

1. **RED**: Write failing tests FIRST (both unit and integration)
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal implementation to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality without changing behavior
4. **VERIFY**: Run tests and check coverage (80%+ required)
5. **FORMAT**: Run code formatter and linter

**Critical TDD Rule**: NEVER write implementation before tests fail

### Within Each Task Type

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD workflow)
- Repository layer before service layer (data access before business logic)
- Service layer before route layer (business logic before HTTP handling)
- Error handling after core implementation (validation after happy path)
- Documentation after implementation stabilizes
- Formatting after implementation complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T001-T003: Must be sequential (create migration → run migration → verify rollback)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T004, T005: Can run in parallel (different test files)
- T006, T007: Can run in parallel (different validation functions)
- T010: Must run after T006-T008 complete

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T011-T014: Can run in parallel (different test cases)
- T015-T016: Can run in parallel (different repository methods)
- T017-T020: Can run in parallel (different integration test cases)
- T021-T022: Must be sequential (interface before implementation)
- T023-T024: Can run in parallel (different methods)
- T026, T027: Can run in parallel (documentation + formatting)
- T028: Must run before T029-T033
- T029-T033: Should be sequential (TDD incremental implementation)
- T035, T037: Can run in parallel (documentation + formatting)
- T038: Must run before T039-T043
- T039-T043: Should be sequential (TDD incremental implementation)
- T044, T045: Can run in parallel (documentation + formatting)
- T051, T052-T053: Can run in parallel (linter + manual tests)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- T054-T061: Can run in parallel (different test cases)
- T062-T070: Can run in parallel (different integration test cases)
- T071-T073: Can run in parallel (different error handling files)
- T082, T088, T091: Can run in parallel (formatting + linting)
- T092-T098: Can run in parallel (different manual test scenarios)

**Phase 5 (Polish)**:
- T099-T104: Can run in parallel (independent verification tasks)
- T106-T107: Can run in parallel (manual testing + criteria verification)

**Platform-Level Parallelization**:
- Since this is backend-only, no platform parallelization available
- Future features with frontend work can parallelize backend + Android + iOS + Web

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (database migration)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (validation infrastructure) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (successful registration)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with manual testing
5. Demo/review successful registration before adding validation

**Estimated LOC**: ~200 lines for MVP (US1 only)

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours for experienced developer with TDD workflow

### Full Feature (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Demo (Full feature)
4. Polish → Final verification

**Estimated LOC**: ~350 lines for full feature (US1 + US2)

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours for experienced developer with TDD workflow

### Parallel Development Strategy (if team)

With 2 developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (2 hours)
2. **Developer A**: User Story 1 (repository + service + routes) (2 hours)
3. **Developer B**: User Story 2 (validation + error handling) (2 hours)
4. **Together**: Integration testing and polish (1 hour)

**Total Parallel Time**: ~5 hours (vs 8 hours sequential)

### Key TDD Workflow Checkpoints

After each GREEN step:
- ✅ Verify tests pass
- ✅ Check coverage (should increase toward 80%)
- ✅ Run linter (no new violations)

After each REFACTOR step:
- ✅ Verify tests still pass (no behavior change)
- ✅ Check code quality (max 3 nesting levels, descriptive names)
- ✅ Run formatter

After each user story:
- ✅ Manual testing with curl/Postman
- ✅ Database inspection (verify data structure)
- ✅ Independent test validation

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story (US1, US2) for traceability
- **TDD Workflow**: RED (failing test) → GREEN (minimal code) → REFACTOR (improve quality)
- **Coverage Requirement**: 80% line + branch coverage MANDATORY
- **Backend-Only**: No Android, iOS, Web implementations needed
- **Reuse Existing Code**: Scrypt hashing, email validation, error handling all exist
- **Clean Code**: Max 3 nesting levels, descriptive names, DRY principle, JSDoc for public APIs
- **ESLint**: MUST be enabled and pass with @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
- **Format After Each Task**: Run `npm run format` after completing each task or logical group
- **Commit Frequently**: Commit after each task or logical group (especially after each GREEN + REFACTOR cycle)
- **Stop at Checkpoints**: Validate user story independently before proceeding
- **No New Dependencies**: All requirements met with existing packages

---

## Success Criteria Validation (from spec.md)

After implementation complete, verify:

- ✅ **SC-001**: Users can successfully register in under 30 seconds (manual test)
- ✅ **SC-002**: System rejects 100% of duplicate emails (integration test T068)
- ✅ **SC-003**: System rejects invalid password lengths (integration tests T066, T067)
- ✅ **SC-004**: System validates 95%+ valid emails (unit tests T055, T056)
- ✅ **SC-005**: Zero plaintext passwords in database (integration test T020, manual verification)
- ✅ **SC-006**: Endpoint responds within 2 seconds (manual test with time measurement)
- ✅ **SC-007**: Clear error messages for 100% failures (integration test T070, manual tests T092-T098)
