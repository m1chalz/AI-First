# API Contracts: iOS Navigation to Fullscreen Map View

**Feature**: KAN-32 | **Date**: 2025-01-07

## No API Changes Required

This feature is **iOS-only UI navigation** with no backend integration:

- No new API endpoints
- No modified API endpoints
- No new request/response schemas

The fullscreen map view is a placeholder that will be populated by future features:
- Map pin display (future ticket)
- Pin tap interactions (future ticket)
- Map search/filter (future ticket)

Those future features may introduce API contracts as needed.
