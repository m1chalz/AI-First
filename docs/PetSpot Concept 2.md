# PetSpot - Lost Pet Recovery Platform
  

## Problem

Millions of pets disappear yearly. Current solutions are fragmented across Facebook groups, paper flyers, and disconnected apps. Pet owners waste critical hours posting to multiple platforms while coverage remains limited.


## Solution

**PetSpot** is a unified lost pet recovery platform that combines **instant multi-channel alerts** with **community-powered search**. One report triggers automatic distribution across app users, Facebook pages, and email networks within the pet's last known area.


## Competitive Landscape


| Solution | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **PawBoost** | Multi-channel alert platform with Facebook/email integration, Rescue Squad community, and premium ad campaigns. Best-in-class reunited rate with 7+ million users globally. North America & UK focused. |
| **Petlog (UK)** | Traditional microchip registry database. 4M+ records, 24/7 support, Kennel Club-backed. Limited to UK, database-only approach. |
| **TASSO (Germany)** | Europe's largest pet registry with 10M+ animals across 26 countries. Free service, 40-year history, excellent in German-speaking regions but not mobile-first. |
| **Petnow** | AI-powered biometric identification using nose prints (dogs) and facial recognition (cats). Expanding to multiple EU countries. 99% accuracy but requires new registration step. |
| **Lost Pets Online** | Simple cross-country app available in Central Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia). Basic alert functionality but limited reach. |
| **Europetnet** | Network connecting 26 national microchip registries. Structural solution to fragmentation but not a consumer-facing application. |
| **Pet Alert France** | Regional Facebook-based alerts organized by department. Low-tech, community-driven, no central platform. France-centric. |
| **Missing Pets** | Basic mobile app with geolocation alerts. 1M+ users but lacks social media integration and community features. |
